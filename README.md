Prerender proxy
===============

Motivation
----------

Easily backup my wix website with a static downloadable version. I wanna use standard tools (like `wget`) but pages are dynamicly generated by ember.

An easy solution is to use a proxy which interpret javascript and returns the generated page to the client.


How it works ?
--------------

```
     wix
      ↑
prerender-proxy
      ↑
     wget
```

The prerender proxy generate dynamic webpages


Usage example
-------------

First, you need to start the prerender proxy :
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

And now, you can crawl your website through the proxy, with `wget` :
```bash
wget --wait 3 --tries 3 -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:3000/ -r -k -E -np http://user.wixsite.com/site
```
